    support in version 2.9.0 (GH#1963, GH#1977)
  - Switch from module-global to thread-local storage when recording thread IDs
    for a logging helper; this should avoid one flavor of memory leak for
    long-running processes (GH#2002, GH#2003)</td>

			<td>2022-03-13</td>
			<td>Paul Howarth &lt;paul at city dash fan dot org&gt; - 2.10.1-1</td>
			<td>- Update to 2.10.1
  - CVE-2022-24302: Creation of new private key files using
    &#39;~paramiko.pkey.PKey&#39; subclasses was subject to a race condition between
    file creation and mode modification, which could be exploited by an
    attacker with knowledge of where the Paramiko-using code would write out
    such files; this has been patched by using &#39;os.open&#39; and &#39;os.fdopen&#39; to
    ensure new files are opened with the correct mode immediately (we&#39;ve left
    the subsequent explicit &#39;chmod&#39; in place to minimize any possible
    disruption, though it may get removed in future backwards-incompatible
    updates)
  - Add support for the &#39;%C&#39; token when parsing SSH config files (GH#1976)
  - Add support for OpenSSH&#39;s Windows agent as a fallback when Putty/WinPageant
    isn&#39;t available or functional (GH#1509, GH#1837, GH#1868)
  - Significantly speed up low-level read/write actions on
    &#39;~paramiko.sftp_file.SFTPFile&#39; objects by using &#39;bytearray&#39;/&#39;memoryview&#39;
    (GH#892); this is unlikely to change anything for users of the higher level
    methods like &#39;SFTPClient.get&#39; or &#39;SFTPClient.getfo&#39;, but users of
    &#39;SFTPClient.open&#39; will likely see orders of magnitude improvements for
    files larger than a few megabytes in size
  - Add &#39;six&#39; explicitly to install-requires; it snuck into active use at some
    point but has only been indicated by transitive dependency on &#39;bcrypt&#39;
    until they somewhat-recently dropped it (GH#1985); this will be short-lived
    until we drop Python 2 support</td>

    overlap between that list and what a Paramiko client supports, now raise
    an exception instead of defaulting to &#39;rsa-sha2-512&#39; (since the use of
    &#39;server-sig-algs&#39; allows us to know what the server supports)
  - Enhanced log output when connecting to servers that do not support
    &#39;server-sig-algs&#39; extensions, making the new-as-of-2.9 defaulting to SHA2
    pubkey algorithms more obvious when it kicks in</td>

    after 2.9.0&#39;s release (signatures for RSA pubkeys were always run through
    &#39;rsa-sha2-512&#39; instead) (GH#1935)</td>

		<tr>
			<td>2021-12-24</td>
			<td>Paul Howarth &lt;paul at city dash fan dot org&gt; - 2.9.0-1</td>
			<td>- Update to 2.9.0
  - Add support for SHA-2 variants of RSA key verification algorithms (as
    described in RFC 8332) as well as limited SSH extension negotiation (RFC
    8308) (GH#1326, GH#1643, GH#1644, GH#1925)
    How SSH servers/clients decide when and how to use this functionality can be
    complicated; Paramiko&#39;s support is as follows:
    - Client verification of server host key during key exchange will now prefer
      rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256, and legacy ssh-rsa algorithms, in that order,
      instead of just ssh-rsa
    - Note that the preference order of other algorithm families such as
      ed25519 and ecdsa has not changed; for example, those two groups are still
      preferred over RSA
    - Server mode will now offer all 3 RSA algorithms for host key verification
      during key exchange, similar to client mode, if it has been configured
      with an RSA host key
    - Client mode key exchange now sends the ext-info-c flag signaling support
      for MSG_EXT_INFO, and support for parsing the latter (specifically, its
      server-sig-algs flag) has been added
    - Client mode, when performing public key authentication with an RSA key or
      cert, will act as follows:
      - In all cases, the list of algorithms to consider is based on the new
        preferred_pubkeys list and disabled_algorithms; this list, like with
        host keys, prefers SHA2-512, SHA2-256 and SHA1, in that order
      - When the server does not send server-sig-algs, Paramiko will attempt
        the first algorithm in the above list; clients connecting to legacy
        servers should thus use disabled_algorithms to turn off SHA2
      - When the server does send server-sig-algs, the first algorithm
        supported by both ends is used, or if there is none, it falls back to
        the previous behavior
    - SSH agent support grew the ability to specify algorithm flags when
      requesting private key signatures; this is now used to forward SHA2
      algorithms when appropriate
    - Server mode is now capable of pubkey auth involving SHA-2 signatures from
      clients, provided one&#39;s server implementation actually provides for doing
      so; this includes basic support for sending MSG_EXT_INFO (containing
      server-sig-algs only) to clients advertising ext-info-c in their key
      exchange list
    In order to implement the above, the following API additions were made:
    - &#39;PKey.sign_ssh_data &lt;paramiko.pkey.PKey&gt;&#39;: Grew an extra, optional
      &#39;algorithm&#39; keyword argument (defaulting to &#39;None&#39; for most subclasses,
      and to &#34;ssh-rsa&#34; for &#39;~paramiko.rsakey.RSAKey&#39;)
    - A new &#39;~paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException&#39; subclass was added,
      &#39;~paramiko.ssh_exception.IncompatiblePeer&#39;, and is raised in all spots
      where key exchange aborts due to algorithmic incompatibility; like all
      other exceptions in that module, it inherits from &#39;SSHException&#39;, and as
      nothing else was changed about the raising (i.e. the attributes and
      message text are the same) this change is backwards compatible
    - &#39;~paramiko.transport.Transport&#39; grew a &#39;_preferred_pubkeys&#39; attribute and
      matching &#39;preferred_pubkeys&#39; property to match the other, kex-focused,
      such members; this allows client pubkey authentication to honor the
      &#39;disabled_algorithms&#39; feature</td>

			<td>2021-11-29</td>
			<td>Paul Howarth &lt;paul at city dash fan dot org&gt; - 2.8.1-1</td>
			<td>- Update to 2.8.1
  - Fix listdir failure when server uses a locale (GH#985, GH#992); now on
    Python 2.7 SFTPAttributes will decode abbreviated month names correctly
    rather than raise &#39;UnicodeDecodeError&#39;
  - Deleting items from &#39;~paramiko.hostkeys.HostKeys&#39; would incorrectly raise
    &#39;KeyError&#39; even for valid keys, due to a logic bug (GH#1024)
  - Update RSA and ECDSA key decoding subroutines to correctly catch exception
    types thrown by modern versions of Cryptography (specifically &#39;TypeError&#39;
    and its internal &#39;UnsupportedAlgorithm&#39;) (GH#1257, GH#1266); these
    exception classes will now become &#39;~paramiko.ssh_exception.SSHException&#39;
    instances instead of bubbling up
  - Update &#39;~paramiko.pkey.PKey&#39; and subclasses to compare (&#39;__eq__&#39;) via
    direct field/attribute comparison instead of hashing (while retaining the
    existing behavior of &#39;__hash__&#39; via a slight refactor) (GH#908)
    Warning:
    This fixes a security flaw! If you are running Paramiko on 32-bit systems
    with low entropy (such as any 32-bit Python 2, or a 32-bit Python 3 that is
    running with &#39;PYTHONHASHSEED=0&#39;) it is possible for an attacker to craft a
    new keypair from an exfiltrated public key, which Paramiko would consider
    equal to the original key.
    This could enable attacks such as, but not limited to, the following:
    - Paramiko server processes would incorrectly authenticate the attacker
      (using their generated private key) as if they were the victim. We see
      this as the most plausible attack using this flaw.
    - Paramiko client processes would incorrectly validate a connected server
      (when host key verification is enabled) while subjected to a
      man-in-the-middle attack. This impacts more users than the server-side
      version, but also carries higher requirements for the attacker, namely
      successful DNS poisoning or other MITM techniques.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>2021-10-11</td>
			<td>Paul Howarth &lt;paul at city dash fan dot org&gt; - 2.8.0-1</td>
			<td>- Update to 2.8.0
  - Administrivia overhaul, including but not limited to:
    - Migrate CI to CircleCI
    - Primary dev branch is now &#39;main&#39; (renamed)
    - Many README edits for clarity, modernization etc.; including a bunch more
      (and consistent) status badges and unification with main project site
      index
    - PyPI page much more fleshed out (long_description is now filled in with
      the README; sidebar links expanded; etc.)
    - flake8, pytest configs split out of setup.cfg into their own files
    - Invoke/invocations (used by maintainers/contributors) upgraded to modern
      versions
  - Newer server-side key exchange algorithms not intended to use SHA1
    (diffie-hellman-group14-sha256, diffie-hellman-group16-sha512) were
    incorrectly using SHA1 after all, due to a bug causing them to ignore the
    &#39;hash_algo&#39; class attribute; this has been corrected (GH#1452, GH#1882)
  - Add a &#39;prefetch&#39; keyword argument to &#39;SFTPClient.get&#39;/&#39;SFTPClient.getfo&#39; so
    that users who need to skip SFTP prefetching are able to conditionally turn
    it off (GH#1846)</td>
