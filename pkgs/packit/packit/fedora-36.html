			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.47.1-1</td>
			<td>- When using Packit CLI for creating Bodhi updates, you can now set `fas_username` and `fas_password`
  in your Packit user config to not be asked about that when the command is executed. (#1517)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2022-03-08</td>
			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.47.0-1</td>
			<td>- When specfile is being generated, and both `specfile_path` and
  `downstream_package_name` are not set, Packit now correctly resolves this
  situation and sets `specfile_path` to the name of the upstream repo suffixed
  with &#34;.spec&#34;. (#1499)
- We are now building SRPMs for Packit&#39;s own PRs in Copr. For more info see #1490 and
  https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#srpm_build_deps (#1490)
- All source-git-commands were updated to append a `From-source-git-commit` or `From-dist-git-commit`
  Git-trailer to the commit messages they create in dist-git or source-git, in order to
  save the hash of the commits from which these commits were created. This information
  is going to be used to tell whether a source-git repository is in sync with the
  corresponding dist-git repository. (#1488)
- Spec file and configuration file are no more automatically added to the list of files
  to sync when the `new files_to_sync` option is used. The old `synced_files` option is
  deprecated. (#1483)
- We have added a new configuration option for Copr builds `enable_net` that allows you to
  disable network access during Copr builds. It is also complemented by
  `--enable-net/--disable-net` CLI options if you use Packit locally. (#1504)</td>

		<tr>
			<td>2022-02-16</td>
			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.46.0-1</td>
			<td>- Synchronization of default files can now be disabled using a new config
  `files_to_sync`. Key `sync_files` is now deprecated. (#1483)
- Packit now correctly handles colons in git trailer values in source-git commits. (#1478)
- Fedora 36 was added to the static list of `fedora-` aliases. (#1480)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2022-02-04</td>
			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.45.0-1</td>
			<td>- A new `packit source-git update-source-git` command has been introduced for
  taking new changes from dist-git (specified by a revision range) to source-git.
  These may include any changes except source code, patches and `Version` tag
  changes in the spec file. ([packit#1456](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1456))
- There&#39;s a new configuration option `create_sync_note` that allows you to
  disable creating of README by packit in downstream. ([packit#1465](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1465))
- A new option `--no-require-autosetup` for `source-git init` command has been
  introduced. Please note that source-git repositories not using `
%setup       -q



` may
  not be properly initialized. ([packit#1470](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1470))</td>

			<td>2022-01-20</td>
			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.44.0-1</td>
			<td>- Packit now correctly finds the release, even if you don&#39;t use the version as
  the title of the release on GitHub. ([packit#1437](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1437))
- Local branches are now named as `pr/{pr_id}` when checking out a PR, even
  when it&#39;s not being merged with the target branch. This results in the NVR
  of the build containing `pr{pr_id}` instead of `pr.changes{pr_id}`. ([packit#1445](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1445))
- A bug which caused ignoring the `--no-bump` and `--release-suffix` options
  when creating an SRPMs from source-git repositories has been fixed. Packit
  also doesn&#39;t touch the `Release` field in the specfile unless it needs to be
  changed (the macros are not expanded that way when not necessary). ([packit#1452](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1452))
- When checking if directories hold a Git-tree, Packit now also allows `.git`
  to be a file with a `gitdir` reference, not only a directory. ([packit#1458](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1458))</td>

- Packit now visibly informs about an ongoing cloning process to remove                                                                                                                                                                     
  potential confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  ([packit#1431](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1431))                                                                                                                                                                               
- The `upstream_package_name` config option is now checked for illegal

  This solves the issue for projects that generate the specfile during this action.
- New config option `env` has been added for specifying environment variables
  used for running tests in the Testing Farm.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>2021-11-11</td>
			<td>Packit Service &lt;user dash cont dash team+packit dash service at redhat dot com&gt; - 0.41.0-1</td>
			<td>- Packit now supports `changelog-entry` action that is used when creating
  SRPM. The action is supposed to generate whole changelog entry (including
  the `-` at the start of the lines) and has a priority over any other way we
  modify the changelog with. (#1367)
- Fixed an issue, which raised an `UnicodeEncodingError`, when working with
  dist-git patch files with an encoding other than UTF-8. (#1406)
- Backup alias definitions now reflect the official release of Fedora Linux 35. (#1405)
- We have introduced a new configuration option `merge_pr_in_ci` that allows
  you to disable merging of PR into the base branch before creating SRPM in
  service. (#1395)
- Fixed an issue, where spec-files located in a sub-directory of upstream
  projects, were not placed in the root of the dist-git repo when proposing
  changes downstream. (#1402)</td>

- We have introduced new options for generating SRPM packages: (#1396)
  - `--no-bump` that prevents changing of the release in the SRPM, which can be used for creating SRPMs on checked out tags/releases.
  - `--release-suffix` that allows you to customize the suffix after the release number, e.g. reference bugzilla or specific branch of the build.</td>

- We have added a new option to Packit CLI when creating Bodhi updates, you can use `-b` or `--resolve-bugzillas` and specify IDs (separated by comma, e.g. `-b 1` or `-b 1,2,3`) of bugzillas that are being closed by the update. (#1383)</td>
